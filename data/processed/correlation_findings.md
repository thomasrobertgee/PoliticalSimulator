# VIC-SIM Correlation Findings

## Statistical Correlations (1980-2024)
### 1. State Debt vs Unemployment
- Correlation Coefficient: **-0.58**
- **Interpretation**: Higher debt correlates with lower unemployment (stimulus effect?)

### 2. Political Stability vs House Prices
- Correlation Coefficient: **1.00**
- **Note**: House price data is sparse, correlation may be skewed.

## Key Observations
Historical interpolation suggests that major political interventions (Reforms, Lockdowns) create significant volatility in GSP trajectories over the subsequent 24-month period.
